Midwifery Employee Representation and Advisory Services (MERAS) members have [voted in favour](https://meras.midwife.org.nz/news/midwives-vote-in-favour-of-interim-pay-equity-deal/) of an interim [pay equity](https://www.employment.govt.nz/hours-and-wages/pay/pay-equity/pay-equity/) deal with Te Whatu Ora.

> The interim agreement increases the base pay for Te Whatu Ora employed midwives by between $2800 and $12,000 per year.

Interestingly, this seems to be a partial agreement, something that aims to get money into pockets while the full process is completed. MERAS started their pay equity process five years ago, so you can see why they wanted to get _something_ done.

[RNZ reports](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/499568/hospital-midwives-vote-overwhelmingly-to-accept-pay-equity-settlement) that a core midwife could now earn between $76,000 and $101,000, and that a senior midwife could earn from $107,000 to $153,000. That is very significant and should help to retain workers.

Good on them for getting something across the line, given their very drawn out process! Now it is time for doctors represented by [RDA](https://nzrda.org.nz/) and [SToNZ](https://www.stonz.co.nz/) to get bargaining as their wage increases have lagged far behind.

[Jo Moir at Newsroom](https://www.newsroom.co.nz/junior-doctors-feel-forgotten-as-bargaining-looms) reports:

> Resident Medical Officers, or junior doctors, have had increasing hours and have continued to drop behind in pay because of inflation and a pay freeze.

This is reinforced by doctors that I personally know: their wages look great, but it's only because most of them are working 60hr/week, and if you calculate their hourly wage it's the same as a teacher. It's tough times for the public health sector. I just hope they can work together to get some real improvements in both conditions and pay.
