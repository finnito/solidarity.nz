It seems that it is all go with union efforts and collective action at the moment.

1. [Union wages are unlikely to be inflationary](https://www.axios.com/2023/10/04/union-wages-pay-hikes-raises-inflation-cost) according to a report issued by Goldman Sachs. There are not enough unionised workers in the US for a "wage-price spiral". With only 10% of workers unionised in the US, and wage increases spread over many years, the effect they will have is estimated to be 0.15% of overall wage growth.

2. [Cory Doctorow – Blood in the Machine](https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/26/enochs-hammer/): Doctorow offers a review and discussion of Brian Merchant's book, Blood in the Machine. As always, Doctorow's view is sharp and well refined. In this post he takes aim at the intersection of automation, labour and unions. The post is well worth a read, and I've added the book to my ever-growing To-Read list.

3. [The Guardian reports](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/oct/03/kaiser-permanente-healthcare-strike-hospital-union-california-washington-dc) that [over 75,000 healthcare workers poised to strike] in the US. The contract between [Coalition of Kaiser Permanente Unions](https://www.unioncoalition.org/) and Kaiser Permanente – a private healthcare provider – expired recently and [negotiations have not been fruitful](https://www.unioncoalition.org/2023-oct-strike-notice/).

Update! [The strike has started](https://truthout.org/articles/75000-kaiser-permanente-workers-begin-largest-health-care-strike-in-us-history/)! 

4. [A new law in California, US, directs schools to teach kids about their workplace rights](https://contracosta.news/2023/10/02/ortega-announces-new-law-to-prevent-child-labor-exploitation/). This comes as there is an uptick in minors being injured in the workplace, and status like Iowa have reduced the age (now 14) at which children can work.

5. [Doctorow returns](https://pluralistic.net/2023/10/05/mr-gotcha/) with a discussion of private equity, union pension funds and how American those dollars are probably used by private equity firms to fund union-busting and other disgraces.
