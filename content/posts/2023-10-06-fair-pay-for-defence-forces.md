One of the latest campaign promises from Labour is [that they will ask the Remuneration Authority to independently set pay rates for defence personnel](https://www.labour.org.nz/news-ensuring_fair_pay_for_our_defence_forces).

> “It’s only fair the independent mechanism should be extended to all defence personnel. Regular and fair binding determinations by the Remuneration Authority will put an end to the historical practice of NZDF pay lurching between catch-up then stagnation for years at a time."

This is a great idea, and comes not long after [a large boost in Defence Force pay was authorised in May, 2023](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/big-boost-defence-force-pay). It was [widely reported](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/489510/new-zealand-increases-defence-force-pay-rates-funding) that personnel were leaving due to poor conditions and worsening pay, and this helped to stem that outgoing tide.

Unfortunately, defence personnel lack the same rights as most of us when it comes to pay negotiations. This is the same for police officers and similar professions. In these cases their bargaining power is diminished, so it seems only fair that there is an independent authority in the mix.

Here is [an interview](https://www.rnz.co.nz/national/programmes/middayreport/audio/2018909673/labour-commits-to-fair-pay-for-defence-force-if-re-elected) with Andrew Little (Labour Defence Spokesperson) on RNZ.
