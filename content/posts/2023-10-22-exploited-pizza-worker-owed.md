[Tom Taylor for Checkpoint, RNZ](https://www.rnz.co.nz/national/programmes/checkpoint/audio/2018912057/exploited-pizza-shop-worker-wants-former-employer-put-in-jail) reports this truly horrific case of worker abuse and unethical behaviour. The case of Deepak Dhiman reflects extremely poorly on both the ethics of some business owners and the immigration system of New Zealand. From not being paid anything during a "training week", to being paid $8/hr when the minimum wage was $13.50/hr, withheld holiday pay, no overtime pay, and a [visa which only allowed him to work for that business](https://www.immigration.govt.nz/new-zealand-visas/visas/visa/accredited-employer-work-visa).

Of course, that visa could have been changed but that could cost up to $750 (94 hours of work, before tax) â€“ which is simply outrageous for someone stuck in those conditions and with that pay. Simply not feasible. In my eyes, this visa leaves the door open to abusive employers and practices and [needs to be looked into](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/496017/accredited-employer-work-visa-scheme-to-be-reviewed-after-whistleblower-s-allegations).

After being referred to Sunny Sehgal, a migrant rights advocate, Dhiman managed to take his case to the Employment Relations Authority (ERA), who ordered the employer to pay him over $98,000 in wage, holiday pay and interest arrears. After ignoring the ERA, the Employment Court has stepped in and I hope that they throw the book at Mann, the employer. This kind of prolonged, abusive behaviour and unwillingness to admit wrongdoing is disgusting and New Zealand should not abide by it.
