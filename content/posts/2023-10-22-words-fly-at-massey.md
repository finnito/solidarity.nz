[As we saw earlier in the week](https://solidarity.nz/posts/2023-10-17-massey-univerisity-protest-cuts/), Massey University is proposing further job cuts, and [Tertiary Education Union (TEU)](https://teu.ac.nz) members were planning to rally at the campus on Wednesday 18 October.

> The university has previously said no decisions would be made until the proposal was "carefully and thoroughly" considered by the college, staff, students and the wider university community.

Unfortunately, Massey seems to be feeling the pressure of the financial year, and have resorted to job cuts and instability for students rather than taking a more considered long-term approach:

> "During a financial year, it is expected there could be adjustments...
> 
> Organisational finances are never static. However, we are confident that adjustments will be minor and not substantive to the financial drivers for the need for a proposal for change,"

The main thing that everyone seems to be asking for is more â€“ time to see how the new Government intends to approach teriary education. Cutting jobs, disrupting education, and losing capacity from the tertiary education sector is not something that they should be jumping head-first into.

TEU has [a petition](https://www.together.org.nz/provide_tertiary_institutions_a_funding_boost_to_enable_good_long_term_staffing_decisions), and [an open letter](https://www.savingtertiary.nz/) to the Minster of Education. Check them out and get involved!
