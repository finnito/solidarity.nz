I am not sure where I originally got recommended this book, but, boy I am pleased that I did. Over the past 12 months, I have become more involved with my union ([PPTA](https://www.ppta.org.nz/)) and have found great personal value in supporting my colleagues with their employment. Despite my stoke, I am still new to all of this and have a vast amount to learn. This book was the beginning of my more in-depth learning about current-day labour, its history, and its past (and often still present) problems.

One of the real strengths of this book was how it showed the many flaws of unions over the years. Unions reflect the society and times in which they exist and they require constant input from their membership to push them forward — to lead. This was most starkly outlined through the progression of unions for certain groups, but not for others. This process repeated many times to include white women, but not Black women, then Black women but not Chinese or Mexican immigrants etc., all the way through to most people except those under the LGBTQ umbrella, and so on. It was a very stark reminder to fight for not only my own rights as a worker but for those who are on the fringe of society or not properly recognised in the current day. Unions can represent and fight for these marginalised groups, but _only if we make them_.

One critique of this book that I have seen is that it contains little [Marxist analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism). However, I don't see that as a negative as I believe it serves a different audience. Kelly comments in the epilogue:

> ... I hope that the stories and characters in _Fight Like Hell_ inspire readers — inspire _you_ — to take action ...

I really do think that is the crux of this book. It is not meant to be an in-the-weeds discussion of power, socioeconomics, or the pitfalls of capitalism, but to engage readers through a diverse set of somewhat forgotten or unknown people and events. If you go into the book knowing its intended audience, I think you cannot be disappointed.

I found this book extremely valuable – despite being centred around American labour – for learning about some of the challenges that labour organisers have faced over the centuries. I have no doubt that workers here in Aotearoa have faced many of the same problems (plus many unique ones) and I am looking forward to learning about them in my future reading.

A massive recommendation from me!
