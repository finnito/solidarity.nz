> ... vocational awe serves a central function in our grotesque work culture. It's a cornerstone of predatory capitalism. If your boss doesn't want to pay you more, they distract you with praise. They puff up your ego by talking about how essential you are to their mission. The culture surrounding public education has done this for decades to quell dissent.

Two really good blog posts get into this concept:

I think it's pretty easy to see places where vocational awe gets used. Here in New Zealand it plays a big role in the public sector and has done a great job at maintaining the status quo of undervaluing the foundations of our society. [Ministries](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/123707034/overstretched-underfunded-and-inequitable-incoming-health-minister-andrew-little-warned-system-is-under-immense-strain) [are](https://www.newsroom.co.nz/ideasroom/in-underfunding-unis-we-have-so-much-to-lose) [chronically](https://www.tehopai.co.nz/about/current-news/news-items/report-calls-for-review-of-underfunded-aged-care-sector.html) [underfunded](https://nzambulance.org.nz/funding); work piles up on people as managers and bosses avoid hiring new staff; the excuse that you "do it for the greater good" or "not in it for the money" or "because they love it" is trotted out again and again. Doctors [work 16 hour shifts](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/313165/safety-questions-as-doctors-work-12-shifts-in-row-of-16-hours) and cover their colleagues because there are no relievers; classrooms increase in size; paperwork (much like stonks) only goes up; and some governments cut funding without stopping to examine the consequences on their staff, and on the country.

But. But! We do it for the love and the praise in lieu of improved pay and conditions and it __has__ to stop.
