On 16 October, 2023 Massey University announced further cuts across the languages, humanities, and social sciences. [Tertiary Education Union (TEU) had something to say about it](https://teu.ac.nz/news/staffing-for-key-subjects-slashed-massey-university-proposal/):

> Kaiwhakahaere | Organiser Ben Schmidt describes the proposals as “completely short-sighted and damaging.”
> 
> "The Massey University Council and Vice Chancellor should immediately halt all staffing cuts and engage with the incoming Government about the future of tertiary education. They need to understand the new Government's priorities before making such drastic decisions."

These cuts come soon after [~100 jobs were announced to be cut](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/education/300981156/outrageous-proposal-to-cut-engineering-plant-science-courses-at-massey-uni) from the sciences and engineering at Massey. Many of the concerns are based around ensuring New Zealand has a population with the expertise to navigate the increasingly complicated and changing world we find ourselves in. There are also worries about how this will affect everyone from undergraduates to PHD students who are in the middle of their study and have committed to living in the area to attend Massey. Will they have to uproot and move to another institution? How will this affect the local business economy in both the short and long term. I'm very inclined to agree with Ben Schmidt, union organiser, on this one:

> "They need to understand the new Government's priorities before making such drastic decisions..."

Lastly, if you are in the area:

> TEU members are rallying with students against these cuts 12:30PM Wednesday 18 October at the Concourse, Manawatū Campus, Massey University.
