[E Tū reports](https://etu.nz/allied-press-journalists-take-24-hour-strike-action/) that more than 40 members are striking for a whole day as part of their stalled negotiations with the [Otago Daily Times](https://www.odt.co.nz).

Rebecca Fox, union delegate, says that wages over the last 15 years have lagged behind inflation and other employers in the industry.

> "Other players in the industry are getting five to six percent pay increases – our last one was two percent," she says.
> 
> Rebecca says it takes around three years for journalists starting out at the ODT to earn even the Living Wage, while those with many years of experience also feel short changed.
> 
> "We have people working with 20+ years of experience who are barely getting the new average salary for Otago* which is around $70,000."
