Te Whatu Ora appears to be [delaying the Pay Equity process for Care and Support Workers](https://etu.nz/te-whatu-ora-must-stop-unjustly-delaying-pay-equity-for-65000-care-and-support-workers/) here in Aotearoa. E Tū, the Public Service Association (PSA), and New Zealand Nurses Organisation (NZNO) are calling on Te Whatu Ora to stop delays via [an open letter](https://our.actionstation.org.nz/petitions/open-letter-fund-pay-equity-for-care-and-support-workers-now) which needs your signature and via a legal challenge.

> "We are disappointed that as we near the end of the process, Te Whatu Ora has interfered and overstepped its role by trying to initiate a review of work on the claim that has already been completed and received the necessary sign off," says E tū Assistant National Secretary Rachel Mackintosh.

[Pay equity processes](https://www.employment.govt.nz/hours-and-wages/pay/pay-equity/pay-equity/) are very important for addressing the discrepancies in pay due to systematic sex-based discrimination. For context, earlier in 2023 [nurses covered by the pay equity agreement](https://www.tewhatuora.govt.nz/whats-happening/what-to-expect/for-the-health-workforce/employment-relations/nurses-pay-equity/) (not community/GP nurses) agreed to a settlement and are receiving large lump-sum payments (some greater than $10,000), and increases of up to 6.5% on their base scale. That is to say, these agreements are not insubstantial!

I would love to know what reason Te Whatu Ora has for requesting a review - I _want_ to give them the benefit of the doubt, but I don't have that much faith, if I'm honest.
