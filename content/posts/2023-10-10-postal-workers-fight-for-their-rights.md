Reporting from RNZ says that members of the [Postal Workers Union of Aotearoa (PWUA)](https://www.pwua.org.nz) have taken action through the Employment Court. They are currently designated contractors and therefore lack certain rights like annual leave, sick leave, public holidays or overtime pay. Their goal is to be declared employees, instead of contractors, and therefore gain these employment benefits.

Current contractors are disadvantaged and are in a poor bargining position because they company can choose to not renew the contract for those who are seeking benefits or unionisation.

The idea with being a contractor is that they charge rates that compensate them for the lack of annual leave, sick leave etc. Unfortunately, in some scenarios contracting becomes [a race to the bottom](https://www.psa.org.nz/our-voice/fair-pay-agreements-good-news-for-employees-but-contractors-need-protection-too/) with regards to wages, and contractors are left without benefits or compensatory pay.
