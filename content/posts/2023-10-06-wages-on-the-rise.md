[TradeMe's Q3 job market update](https://www.trademe.co.nz/c/jobs/news/five-year-peak-in-applications-as-salaries-reach-new-high), released on 5 October 2023 shows the average salary in Aotearoa broke the $70,000/year mark, up $5,500 from the same time last year. You can [see the data for individual sectors here](https://www.trademe.co.nz/a/jobs/salary-guide) – go see how yours stacks up!

Education, for example, is called out:

> Mr Tolich said the largest increases by sector were seen in Healthcare (up 10 per cent on last year to $70,649), Trades & Services (up 9 per cent to $71,283), Manufacturing & Operations (up 9 per cent to $62,859), Education (up 8 per cent to $69,487) and Hospitality & Tourism (up 8 per cent to $61,607). 

And the graph certainly does look good, however, it's important to remember that the Ministry of Education never gave us pay rises out of the goodness of their hearts, it was only through hard fights and collective action of the PPTA that we gained those pay rises.

> “These industries really are the backbone of Aotearoa - they’re our builders, teachers, chefs and factory workers - and it’s great to see these Kiwi being recognised for the contribution they make.”

It's also very necessary to remember that when adjusting for inflation, the maximum salary of a teacher has been relatively stagnant for the past 20 years, gaining only about $150 of inflation-adjusted buying power.

Things may be looking up, but it's good to remember the facts of the situation.

Kia kaha!
