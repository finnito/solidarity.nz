Excellent news yesterday evening where [FIRST Union](https://www.firstunion.org.nz/my-industry/retail-finance-and-commerce/supermarket-workers) reported:

> Almost 200 Costco workers who are members of the FIRST Union have signed a pay deal that will include a starting rate of $26.50 an hour.

The deal is said to include a pathway to $30/hr after four years, as well as including overtime and penal rates. This comes as the [Living Wage rate was set to $26/hr](https://www.livingwage.org.nz/) as of 1 September, 2023.

You can read more reporting from [Stuff](https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/money/300981630/costco-workers-strike-pay-agreement) and [RNZ](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/business/499290/costco-union-members-win-pay-deal-above-the-living-wage).

Ka rawe to mahi!
